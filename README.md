# mtgdrawsim
Shuffler + Draw simulator for MTG: Arena decks

# The purpose.
This project will be used as part of my statistical analysis on how good the Magic: The Gathering Arena shuffler algorhitm is.
Considering this is the easy part, the hard part will be take a while and a lot of games for me to get the initial 7 card draws from the game and write it down

Beware that i don't know the exact method of shuffling, but i tried to mimic a reasonably good physical shuffling routine.


# Usage

Usage: ./drawsim.py <deck file> <draw amount>

The deck file must be in the format exported from mtg arena

if draw amount is 0 the result of the shuffle will be displayed
